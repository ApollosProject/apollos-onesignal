# Apollos OneSignal
A Rock transport for OneSignal. Allows notifications to enabled devices through the OneSignal service. 

## Initial Setup
### If you are on a stable version of Rock (you update Rock from the button in the UI)
* Clone down the this `apollos-onesignal` repo [here](https://github.com/ApollosProject/apollos-onesignal).
* Copy the apollosProject.OneSignal.dll and apollosProject.OneSignal.pdb from the /bin folder.
* Paste them in the Rockweb/bin folder of your Rock instance.

### If you are on an unstable (pre-alpha) version of Rock (you pull the Rock repo and build it yourself)
* Clone down the this `apollos-onesignal` repo [here](https://github.com/ApollosProject/apollos-onesignal).
* Put the `apollos-onesignal` folder in the same folder as your `Rock` folder. They should be co-located together.
* In your Rock solution, add the `apollos-onesignal` project. 
* Right-click on your Rock solution and choose `Project Build Order` from the menu.
* Go to the `Dependencies` tab, choose the `apollos-onesignal` project from the dropdown, and click the checkboxes to make `Rock` and `Rock.Common` dependencies. This will ensure that in your build tool that `apollos-onesignal` won't be built until after `Rock` and `Rock.Common`. This is important because `apollos-onesignal` depends on those two projects.
* Now you can run `Clean Solution` and `Rebuild Solution` and everything should just build. Also, when you push changes, your build tool of choice should work as well!

## Rock Setup
* Inside Rock, go to `Admin > Communications > Communication Transports`.
* You should see an option for One Signal. If not, you may need to restart your Rock server. Either way, Rock should detect that the new DLL is there and automatically add the transport to the list on that page. Click on that transport.
* You will need to change the `Active` flag to `Yes` and add the One Signal `App Id` and `REST API Keys`. You can find these on the OneSignal website on the `Settings` page under `Keys & IDs`.
* Go to `Admin > Communications > Communication Mediums`.
* Click on `Push Notifications`
* Make sure the `Active` flag is set to `Yes` and set the `Transport Container` to `One Signal`.

Now youâ€™re all set to send push notifications through Rock!
